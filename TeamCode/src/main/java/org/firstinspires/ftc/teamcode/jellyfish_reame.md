jellyfish_readme.md

This text file lists the latest "official" source file(s) in this directory to be used for competition.  
It should be updated whenever the software team released a verified combination of code and configuration files for the anticipated tournament.
This is so everyone on the team is in sync with which files to be used to test-drive, verify, etc.
This will also help track which code was used for which tournament.

For example, 
Nov6_tournament = "XYZ.java", "CONFIG.xml"

**********
Nov6_tournament = " ", " "
