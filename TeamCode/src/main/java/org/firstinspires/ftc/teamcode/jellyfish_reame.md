jellyfish_readme.md

This file lists the latest "official" file(s) in this directory to be used for competition.  
Should be updated whenever the software team released a verified version for the anticipated tournament.
This is so everyone on the team is in sync with which file to be used for test-drive, verification, etc.
We will also then keep track of what code was used for which tournament.

For example, 
Nov6_tournament = "XYZ.java"

*****
Nov6_tournament = " "
